parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
    description="""Fit univariate profile using gptools/profiletools.

BASIC USAGE DETAILS:

Calling without arguments will enter an interactive mode, or you can use the
command line flags to completely specify the options you wish to use. This
program can operate on ne, Te data from the tree, or you can provide data in a
NetCDF or CSV file.

You can choose whether to average over a time window, a specific set of points
or to use a single time slice. Even if providing data in a file, you should
specify the shot number and time window so that appropriate constraints can be
imposed on the fit at the magnetic axis and edge, and so that coordinate
transformations can be performed.

EXAMPLES:

Basic way to fit ne profile from shot 1101014006, averaged over the flat top
from 0.965s to 1.365s, using core and edge TS:

    %s --shot 1101014006 --signal ne --t-min 0.965 --t-max 1.365 --system TS

Basic way to fit data from NetCDF file foo.nc, assuming the data are from the
time window 0.965s to 1.365s of shot 1101014006. The abscissa is specified to be
normalized poloidal flux and is stored in the variable psin in the NetCDF file.
The ordinate is stored in the variable q and its uncertainty in err_q:

    %s -i foo.nc --coordinate psinorm --t-min 0.965 --t-max 1.365 -x psin -y q --shot 1101014006

FIXING/IMPROVING THE FIT:

Several things can go wrong in the fit. If there are bad points/outliers in your
data you can attempt to remove them by specifying one or both of
--change-threshold and --outlier-threshold, or you can flag specific points by
their indices using --remove-points. Change threshold rejects points that are
too distant from their neighbors, outlier threshold rejects points that are too
distant from the fit.

If there are not apparent outliers, but the fit still looks bad, then there is
likely an issue with the estimation of the fit's properties -- namely the
so-called hyperparameters that dictate the spatial correlation between points.
Try increasing the --random-starts flag to at least 8 as a first cut. This may
make the fit take quite a bit longer, but is parallelized, so the more cores
your computer has, the faster you will have your answer. If this still yields
unsatisfactory fits, try adjusting the bounds for the hyperparameters using
--bounds.

Note that many warnings regarding overflow in cosh and casting complex values
will be emitted -- these are usually benign. You will also see warnings that
the minimizer failed. These indicate that a particular random guess for the 
hyperparameters walked the minimizer into a bad state. At the end of the
optimization you will be told how many starts were accepted. Try to increase
--random-starts and/or adjust --bounds until this number is at least 4.

READING FROM FILES:

The support for reading data from NetCDF and CSV files is fairly powerful. With
either type of file, you can specify the column/variable names to be of the form
"name [units]" which will be automatically parsed to generate the right plot
labels. (Though it is better to just set the "units" attribute of each variable
in your NetCDF file, which is the preferred approach there.) The CSV reader is
smart enough to figure out your column names, as long as you put the time column
first when using data you haven't time-averaged yet. In either type of file you
can include the metadata needed to apply core/edge constraints. For CSV files,
start the file with as many lines needed of the form "name data" or
"name data,data,..." Be sure to either make the first line be "metadata N" where
N is the number of metadata lines used or specify --metadata-lines when doing
this! For NetCDF files, simply place the metadata in the appropriate attributes
of the file. The supported metadata are:

        ========== =======================================================
        shot       shot number
        times      comma-separated list of times included in the data
        t_min      minimum time included in the data
        t_max      maximum time included in the data
        coordinate the abscissa the data are represented as a function of,
                   valid choices are:
                   {psinorm,Rmid,r/a,volnorm,phinorm,sqrtpsinorm,sqrtr/a,
                    sqrtvolnorm,sqrtphinorm}
